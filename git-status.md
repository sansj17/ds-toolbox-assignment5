# Definition: git status

The git status command provides an overview of the current state of your working directory and staging area.
It tells you which changes have been staged, which files are being tracked, as well as indicating if the local branch is ahead/behind of the remote one.
You can view it on the JupyterLab IDE using the Git extension, located on the left panel.
